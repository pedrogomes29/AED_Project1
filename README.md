# Simulation of an Airline Company Information Management System 

### Project Description

A simple airline company internal system who can deal with basic and advanced tasks which are normal in these branch of companies and business.

This project was developed by Pedro Gomes (up202006322) Rui Pires (up202008252) in the scope of our curricular unity "Algorithms and Data Structures".

### Implementations
Our program gives the user several options, starting with the most general ones(add planes, change a plane, check the database or view information
on local transport to a given airport).

This program also insures data persistence, since we use files to store almost everything (besides the company's operating airports.).
